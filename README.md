 # Paper Airplane Numerical Study
  Final Project: AEM 3103 Spring 2024

  - By: Franklin Woolley, Thomas Herbert

  ## Summary of Findings
  <Show the variations studied in a table>

  In this project we made verious plots to show how a paper plane behaves under different circumstances. 
  Summarized what was accomplished in this study.  Describe 2-4 observations from simulating the flight path.
  Reference the figures below as needed.

  *If the analysis falls short of the goal, this is your chance to explain what was done or what were the barriers.*
 
  # Code Listing
  A list of each function/script and a single-line description of what it does.  The name of the function/script should link to the file in the repository on GitHub.

  Range vs. height graphs for initial velocities of 2 (red), 3.55 (black), and 7.5 (green) m/s on the left graph and for initial flight path angles -0.5 (red), -0.18 (black), and 0.4 (green) radians on the right graph.
